#### Improvements

1. Now you can add labels with whitespaces or special characters by putting them in curly braces, eg. `#{label with whitespaces}`. [See the docs](./usage.md#label-or-label-with-spaces-or-special-characters) for the details.

#### Bug fixes

1. Fixed a bug where black or colorless (grey) labels prevented the Power-Up to load the name of lists.
